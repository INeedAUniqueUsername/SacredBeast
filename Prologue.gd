	'"Wait, what? There\'s a Kingdom of Good & Evil? I thought that was just something we made up? Also, is that a TORNADO??" Rob said.',
	'Little did he know, the Kingdom of Good & Evil was definitely a real thing. It was never something the band were meant to know about - until... it was time.',
	'Suddenly, the tornado swept the entire band into the sky. (One could say they were Taken for a Ride.)',
	'The band went up and up and up - far from the Earth, far past the obscure. They went so high up that they could see anything - out in the twilight.',
	'Eventually, the winds stopped and the band began falling... but not towards the park.',
	'When they landed, the band found themselves in a land above the clouds - Talhalla.',
